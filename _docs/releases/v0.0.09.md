**v0.0.9** - OpenAI
> Goal: Optimize service for persistence and pagination.

Quite a big block of changes, I broke down on the following phases in order to make it happen:

**Phase 1:**
- [X] persist messages on askOpenAI
    - [X] OpenAI service updated to Chat Completions API
    - [X] Usage field mapping fixed
    - [X] Test shows proper responses and usage tracking
    - [X] No more persistence errors in sendMessage

**Phase 2:**
- [X] Study OpenAI Responses API
    - [X] update askOpenAI to use OpenAI Responses API
    - [X] Revert openAI service to responses API
    - [X] Update Message model to match usage field
    - [X] Fix multi-turn conversation handling
    - [X] Update tests and Run

**Phase 3:**
- [X] Paginate messages: build a cursor-based pagination system that:
    - [X] Loads messages in chunks (e.g., 20 at a time)
    - [X] Uses cursor (last message ID) instead of page numbers
    - [X] Provides hasNextPage and nextCursor for infinite scroll
    - [X] Maintains chronological order (newest first)
    - [X] Update GraphQL schema adding MessageConnection, MessageEdge and PageInfo types
    - [X] Create utils/pagination.ts with cursor-based pagination logic and connection builder
    - [X] Update resolvers (message query) to use cursor-based pagination
    - [X] Create test-pagination.ts and run it

**Phase 4:**
- [X] Add title field on askOpenAI from first assistance reply
    - [X] Update conversation model with the field
    - [X] Create titleGenerator.ts with generateConversationTitle and updateConversationTitle functions
    - [X] Wired up the titleGenerator to conversations (startConversation and sendMessage mutations)
    - [X] Refactored startConversation to use askOpenAI instead of simply receiving "title" from user
    - [X] Test titleGenerator on a file

**Phase 5:**
- [X] Add summary field on conversation
    - [X] Add summary field to conversation type
    - [X] Create summaryGenerator.ts with generateConversationSummary and updateConversationSummary functions
    - [X] Wired up the summaryGenerator to conversations (sendMessage mutations - logic is going to be to generate summaries after 10+ messages and keep it updated on the go - 5 messages after that)
    - [X] Background processing, so we don't block the main thread
    - [X] Test summaryGenerator on a file

**Comming up next:** 
Caching, Docker, Winston and Jest.
